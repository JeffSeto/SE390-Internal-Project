## Initial idea

The idea is that we can have a visual course selection tool that helps students pick their schedule since many students often have a hard time dealing with time conflicts and prereqs. We envision that this tool will have an excellent user interface to easy the pain of picking courses by having several key features.

* Search: we want students to be able to quickly find courses by searching for keyword or course code
* Visualization: we want students to be able to visualize their schedules as they are building it so that they don't get awkward gaps or really busy days. We also want to be able to visualize different sections so that students can pick the option they want 
* Automatic conflict resolution: Sometimes students will have very busy schedules so we want to be able to pick the right schedules to minimize conflicts
* Suggested courses: We can recommend courses to students based on what program they are in, what courses they've taken, and what courses have good ratings

### Competitors

* Schedule storm: broken and doesn't work
* Coursicle: Isn't integrated with a course data source so it is basically a calendar app
* Griddy(u of t): Search is bad, visualization for sections is not good
* VSB(york): search is bad, UI is clunky and unintuitive

There are a couple more but they almost always fall into two categories, either they are more or less a calendar app with some extra functionality or they have bad user experience and especially poor search functionality.
